<h2 align='center'>👨‍💻 Kartavya's Coding Journey 👨‍💻</h2>
<details open align="center">
   <summary></summary>
   My journey in coding began when I was in sixth grade, and my fascination with the endless possibilities of technology led me to start learning Python and SQL on my own. Over time, I honed my skills in these languages through various online courses and personal projects, such as developing a weather app, snake game, and scientific calculator. As I progressed through high school, I took on more challenging projects, including collaborating with a team of students to build a lexicographic permutation calculator, interning as an IT head for a budget boutique hotel and website manager for an upcoming astrologer's business.

   My passion for coding also led me to explore other areas of technology, such as data analysis and machine learning, and I've completed several online courses and certifications to expand my knowledge in these fields.

   Looking forward, I'm excited to continue my coding journey in college and beyond, with a focus on using technology to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact on society. Whether it's developing new applications or improving existing systems, I believe that coding has the power to create meaningful change, and I can't wait to be a part of it.
